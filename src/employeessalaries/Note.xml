Modify the following application so it calculates the yearly salaries of employees. The tasks that need to be done are the following:

Make sure the class Employee implements the interface Taxes.


Define the method getGrossSalary() within Employee class. Assume that the gross salary is equal to the following equation:
Base salary + Time employed bonus
Where: 
Base salary = $40000/year
Time employed bonus = $1000/year employed


Define the method getNetSalary() within Employee class. Assume that the net salary is equal to the following equation:
Gross salary - (Gross salary * Tax rate)
Note: 

Tax rate should be obtained by invoking the getTaxRate() static method located within the interface Taxes.
Create a child class Manager that inherits from the class Employee. Override the method getBonus() so that each manager gets an extra $10000 additional to the time employed bonus.
